# 100-shitty-projects

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I had some trouble getting `npx create-react-app` itself to work because of some legacy dependencies? 

TODO: 
- [ ] Add in projects card component 
- [ ] Add in projects data 
- [X] Add in progress bar 
    - The font size kinda sucks 

- Scripts: 
    - `npm start` to run the app in dev mode 
    - `npm test` to run the tests 
    - `npm run build` to build the app for prod 
    - `npm run eject` basically never used, but can eject a dependency from a build if needed
